In this project, a Breast Cancer Classification system is built using Deep Learning with Python. Here a simple Neural Network(NN) is build with Tensorflow and Keras in Python.

The breast_cancer dataset may not be available in the next update of sklearn (1.2). So, we can instead use the dataset from the link below.
